This repository contains two Python scripts—assignment4task1.py and assignment4task2.py—that demonstrate basic file handling operations in Python. The first script reads the content of a file named sample.txt, printing each line with line numbers, and gracefully handles the case where the file does not exist. The second script allows the user to write input to a file named output.txt, append additional text to it, and then read and display the complete contents of the file. These programs provide a simple introduction to reading, writing, appending, and exception handling in file operations.
